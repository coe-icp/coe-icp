# DAO Structure and Commitment to Decentralization

### Commitment to Community-Driven Management

COE's ultimate goal is full community governance, exercised through decentralized voting by holders of governance rights (ap-coe and sp-coe NFTs). This structure fully delegates control over macro-project decisions, resource allocation, and future strategy setting to the community.

#### Status and Roadmap for DAO Tool Development

In the initial stages, basic voting tools were provided through existing platforms. However, due to infrastructural changes, COE is now committed to developing a proprietary and On-Chain DAO Tool.

DAO Tool Development Roadmap:

* Research and Requirements Analysis: Analyzing the technical and security requirements for a dedicated DAO tool on the ICP platform.
* Internal Development: Developing the voting infrastructure based on cutting-edge technologies (such as the upcoming caffeine.ai project) to ensure the highest level of security and decentralization.
* Implementation: Upon completion of development, the dedicated DAO tool will be officially launched, and project governance control will be transferred to the community.

This structure demonstrates that COE not only believes in decentralization but is committed to building the necessary infrastructure for it.
