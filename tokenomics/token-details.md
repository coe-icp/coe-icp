### The first COE token trading pool

As you know, 5% of COE token liquidity is allocated for cooperation programs. The COE project has created its first trading pool with the BABYAROF token earlier than expected.

In this liquidity pool, 1% of the liquidity of the COE token is placed along with 3% of the total liquidity of BABYAROF tokens. The document creating this trading pool has been burned and is no longer available.

### The second COE token liquidity pool

The ICPswap team has always supported our new ideas and helped us grow and develop. They are an active and hardworking team who have increased their experience in developing the ICP ecosystem and rewritten the ICS token structure in the best possible way.\
After attracting ICS capital in NNS and distributing ICS tokens, the COE project put an amount equal to 1% of the liquidity of COE tokens to the ICS/COE trading pool and left the liquidity document of this pool in the black hole.

This action was taken at the same time as the opening of FOOD COE is approaching as the first traditional business to be integrated with the project and token under the supervision of the COE team. 10% of the revenue from the FOOD COE trade is injected into the COE token through the BABYAROF/COE trading pair. In this case, with the monthly arrival of liquidity from the BABYAROF/COE pair, we can expect to open a path for arbitrage through the ICS/COE pair. Gradually, with the growth of the transactions of these two trading pairs, the support of the COE token will increase.

The BABYAROF and ICS tokens are valuable options as the primary supports of the COE token! Because these two tokens use the token burning structure to grow the value of assets, and they are also completely decentralized and active in the ICP ecosystem.
