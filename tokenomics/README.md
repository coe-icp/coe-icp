### 21 million tokens

coe has considered a maximum liquidity of 21 million for its token.\
The number of **21 million** tokens is inspired by Bitcoin and we believe that the COE token will have the potential to grow like Bitcoin.

#### Transfer fees between wallets and transactions

The coe token on the ICP chain is ICRC-1 standard, we will not charge any fees for transfers and transactions of this token. Therefore, COE is a cryptocurrency, it can easily be a new way to pay.\
Very high transaction speed and almost zero fees are two important features of this cryptocurrency.

#### Distributing more than 50% of cash with farm help

50% of COE token liquidity will be distributed with the help of the farm and this distribution will take **5 years**.

The time set for the token distribution with the help of the farm is planned in such a way that it can be done in parallel with the distribution and growth of traditional businesses, thus preventing the arbitrary distribution of the coe token.\
In this way, the value of the coe token will be maintained and users will bear less risk.

### <mark style="color:red;">Important note !!</mark>

In most cryptocurrency projects, developers keep LP with them when they do the initial pricing! Especially when it is stated in the white paper that a significant part of the liquidity will be distributed with the help of the farm, then the development team will benefit the most from the situation and load their LP token, which is the largest volume of liquidity, to receive the token in the farm !

And of course, in this case, the development team can release the liquidity whenever they want and withdraw all the capital from the project!

<mark style="color:red;">**But the coe project is committed, after the initial pricing, to burn the LP of the original token that is made in the ICPswap exchange so that it is no longer in the possession of any person or team, in this case the development team cannot abuse.**</mark>
