# coe token value

**This project is the beginning of a revolution among traditional businesses, a revolution that will spread the message of tokenization of traditional businesses to the whole world.**\
**Community-oriented economy will undoubtedly be the choice of any community from any part of the world, because governments and hands behind the curtain cannot be directly involved in the ups and downs of asset value.**

### The main features of the coe token

1. Very high speed of transactions
2. Very low transfer fees
3. 100% security for token and token support
4. Directing financial flow from traditional market to token liquidity
5. Valid all over the world
6. The identity of the investors is unclear (taxes and assets are not applied)

Note, after the initial pricing of each token, the most important factor that causes the price of the token to grow is the arrival of liquidity or the growth of demand for the desired token.

This is exactly the reason why small tokens fail along the way. Because either they should increase the growth of demand by paying for advertising or they should consider a basic application for the token so that this application encourages and grows demand.

This is a little different for the coe project!\
By creating traditional businesses and generating income from the traditional market, the coe project will become the largest applicant for the coe token and guarantee the value growth for the token!

**This happens in such a way that the whole community shares in the current income of the traditional COE business in a fair way!**

So, in this case, COE can guarantee the growth of demand and the growth of asset value for users by generating current income from the traditional market.\
Along the way, the more traditional businesses develop and the higher the current income, it can be expected that the value of the COE token will grow faster.

### How is the transfer of capital from the traditional market to token liquidity?

Each business that is selected and established after voting is committed to transparently inject a predetermined percentage of its revenue into the token economy. It happens like this, the traditional business has to buy the COE token with the set amounts and put the monitored token volume into the monthly pools.

The volume of the pools each month can vary depending on the income of the traditional business, and it is not possible to predict how much liquidity will be distributed in the pool in the next month.
