### Who are the initial community of the coe project?

In the first stage of the roadmap, the COE project deals with attracting users, attracting capital, creating a safe educational environment and selling the main shares.\
The development of COE is summarized in three parts:

2. sp-coe
3. coe

#### ap-coe collection

The ap-coe collection consists of 10,000 token NFTs, all of which will be distributed to the ICP chain user community over several stages.\
This NFT collection is made with the aim of attracting more users, the holders of these NFTs will have the right to vote in the DAO section, and also 2% of the coe token liquidity will be distributed among the holders of these NFTs. All this collection will be distributed only as airdrop and users can start trading in the open market.

#### sp-coe&#x20;

The sp-coe collection consists of 1000 different NFTs that will be sold entirely in the launchpad section.\
Users who are holders of ap-coe NFTs are placed in the white list and can buy these sp-coe NFTs at half price.\
sp-coe holders have higher voting rights. 1% of coe token liquidity is distributed among the holders of these 1000 NFTs

All the income from this collection will be spent on the development and construction of the infrastructure of the coe project.

#### coe collection
