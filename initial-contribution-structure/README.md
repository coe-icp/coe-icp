# Initial Contribution Structure

COE is a community-driven ecosystem, and its sustainability relies on the active participation and early support of its members. The initial development phase (Phase 0 to 1) focused on community growth, creating educational infrastructures, and securing the necessary resources for market research.

This initial development was implemented through the following structure:

* ap-coe (Active Participation Collection)
* sp-coe (Strategic Pioneer Collection)

#### ap-coe Collection (Active Participation Rewards)

The ap-coe collection consists of 10,000 token NFTs, all distributed via Airdrop (free distribution) with the aim of rapid community expansion and attracting active contributors on the ICP chain.

Rights and Benefits of ap-coe Holders:

* Voting Rights: Holders of these NFTs possess governance rights within the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) structure.
* Loyalty Rewards: A total of 42 COE Tokens per NFT were distributed as loyalty rewards to strengthen early engagement.
* Purpose: To establish a core group to support educational and developmental activities.

#### sp-coe Collection (Strategic Financial Support and Research)

The sp-coe collection comprises 290 NFTs. This collection was created to secure vital resources for market research, technical development, and the execution of operational prototypes.

Resource Mechanism and Rights of sp-coe Holders:

* Contribution Process: Community members who had previously received ap-coe NFTs via Airdrop had priority access to contribute to this collection.
* Specialized Governance: sp-coe holders possess higher voting rights in the DAO to play a more prominent role in strategic and macro project decisions.
* Operational Outcome: The resources secured from this collection (equivalent to 180 ICP Tokens) were used directly to establish the Food COE business and successfully execute the research and loyalty model development phase in the real market.
