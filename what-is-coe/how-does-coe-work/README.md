# How does coe work?

### What is the mission of COE?

COE's mission is to create and support traditional businesses and direct liquidity from the traditional market to its decentralized economic flow.\
The creation of traditional brands, so that the business created in the physical space begins to operate and presents its accounting reports in the form of established frameworks to the public members of the coe community. The established business must bring at least a certain percentage of its income from the traditional market to its business cycle. The established business must describe exactly the amount of its financial input and output during a month, and all reports must be presented in the form of daily and weekly reports.\
The accounting system should be available to the public as an open source, and users should be able to view traditional business transactions in real time.

**coe is actually an economic chain that will increase the value of its token by creating demand without the growth of its own users' demand.**

### How does COE fulfill its mission comprehensively?

COE has planned its future in several stages and is moving in the direction of its plans:

1. Education and culturalization among the community, for free
2. Invitation to participate and sell coe shares
3. Voting by the community and choosing the business to be created by the coe
4. The business is launched and guided in the direction of the programs provided

These four stages are always ongoing and never stop, the COE is always training new users and attracting new investors to the COE, voting is always taking place, and new traditional businesses are created one after another.

#### Now let's see how coe will grow its economic chain by creating traditional businesses.

This situation is exactly like investing in Tesla or Apple, but on a much smaller scale! The smallness of this structure does not change anything, because in the same dimensions we have fewer users and profits will be divided between fewer people.\
COE is the gathering place of the first community chain, of course, this chain is growing every day, but the first users will gather in COE, get training, choose a business in DAO voting and invest in it!

This community selection is done among several proposed businesses with specific plans! For example, the community will vote on the number of five old businesses that present their goal in the form of a development plan, and we will develop one.

The desired business starts operating in the traditional market and enters a predetermined part of the income into its financial chain.\
In this way, the COE token is purchased and returned to the liquidity pool to return to the economic flow fairly and reach the community.
