# Creating a traditional business collectively and without risk

Imagine that we are going to start a restaurant individually, we need at least 10 thousand dollars in capital for this action, and of course, we will probably have many challenges along the way! It is true that all the profit from the income of this restaurant will be for one person, but in the same proportion all the risks will be for one person, and of course, the lower class of society may not be able to make such an investment!

But in the second stage of the road map, COE can plan a restaurant project for the community and reduce the risk of investors below 5%! Instead of 1 person investing 10 thousand dollars, 10 thousand people should invest 1 dollar! There is no more risk of losing capital, no more arguing with the shop owner or the tax office, users will have a part of the restaurant with only a very small amount!

**In this way, it can be said that the community of COE users have all become restaurant owners with the least risk, and they benefit fairly from the restaurant's income.**

> Do not forget that the restaurant is only one example
