# How does coe work?

The COE structure is built on the precise engineering of value flow. Merging traditional businesses with a decentralized token structure is made possible not through financial promises, but by creating a sustainable loyalty flow.

The mechanism works as follows: Businesses allocate a portion of their generated value towards community rewards. This value is converted into Loyalty Tokens via COE's mechanisms and distributed instantly to community members. This cycle ensures long-term loyalty while coinciding with the business's operational growth.

This model is the result of three years of research and prototype execution in real-world markets. To learn more about the operational performance, you can review the following report:

### How does the price growth of the COE token happen?

Injecting financial flow from the traditional market into the COE token can achieve price growth without demand from the community. Integrating any new business with the COE marketing plan and the COE token can accelerate the growth of the token price.

We support traditional businesses to create customer clubs with the help of NFTs, tokenize customer club members, and reward their customer club members with a portion of their financial input in the form of COE tokens.
