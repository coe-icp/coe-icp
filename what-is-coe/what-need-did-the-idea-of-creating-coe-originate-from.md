# What need did the idea of creating coe originate from?

### What need caused the creation of the coe project?

**The need for justice, at least regarding the financial and monetary situation of the societies...**

One of the problems of societies, especially third world societies, is the effects of macro policies on the financial lives of neutral members of society!

**The mission of cryptocurrencies and blockchain is to decentralize and create justice between users regardless of their skin color and country of birth. Let's help and speed up this great mission!**

Imagine that in the first world countries, macroeconomic decisions are crucial for the financial status of people in the society...\
But in the second and third world countries, the effects of the macro policies of the first world affect the economic policies, and as a result, the members of the second and third world societies have two variables for the financial and monetary situation, the first is the political situation, the second is the economic situation in the country.

#### Let's examine this mission with an example

Consider a country called X, the international policies of the rulers of country X have caused sanctions from the first world countries.\
The economic pressure of these sanctions has been imposed on the people of the society and it is destroying the lives of many innocent families!

Is it justice that because of the political fights of the rulers, the poor people of the society are destroyed?\
It is definitely not fair, because the people of the society had no role in political decisions and are not decision makers!

> **Do you have any questions now?**\
> **How to decentralize and establish financial justice?**

* Creating a chain of economic and monetary flows without borders and without authentication
* creating a common currency under the shadow of macroeconomics and banks with higher security than banking structures!
* Creating a common currency between volunteers and primary contributors
* decentralized
* a currency that is easily valid anywhere and no one knows the location and identity of the asset owner!

A currency that connects with traditional businesses and creates a win/win economy for the community, a currency that uses decentralized voting and DAO structure for economic decisions...\
A currency whose mission is to support traditional businesses and create employment in countries!\
Any traditional business that is added to the chain and tokenized will have a positive impact on the primary structure, that is, on the value of the coe currency.

<mark style="color:green;">**COE will create a revolution in economic structures! All societies will be attracted to society-oriented economy! An economy that guarantees definite profit for the society, an economy that will undoubtedly give users annual value growth! We are here.**</mark>
