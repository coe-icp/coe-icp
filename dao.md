### DAO for coe community members

The DAO in the coe project is special for NFT holders, the people who hold the NFTs of the project are allowed to participate in the DAO section and can participate in the decisions of the project.

The coe project consists of three NFT collections, which respectively have different voting power.

1. Each NFT of the ap-coe collection has one voting power
2. Each NFT of the sp-coe collection has three voting powers
3. Each NFT of the coe collection has five voting powers

Now, if a wallet from a collection holds more than one NFT, the voting rights of that wallet will be proportionally higher.
