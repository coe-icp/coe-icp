# DAO

### What is a DAO?

The DAO is a community-driven structure used to manage cryptocurrency projects.\
A transparent method for community participation in a fair way without the need for authentication.

### DAO for coe community members

The DAO in the coe project is special for NFT holders, the people who hold the NFTs of the project are allowed to participate in the DAO section and can participate in the decisions of the project.

The coe project consists of three NFT collections, which respectively have different voting power.

1. Each NFT of the ap-coe collection has one voting power
2. Each NFT of the sp-coe collection has three voting powers
3. Each NFT of the coe collection has five voting powers

Now, if a wallet from a collection holds more than one NFT, the voting rights of that wallet will be proportionally higher.

### Voting power of COE token holders

Apart from all NFTs that have the right to vote in the DAO, COE token holders also have the right to participate and vote, although only the top 100 holders.

The 100 largest COE token holders will vote from the largest to the smallest power. In the list of top 100 holders, any wallet with more assets has more voting power.

For example: the wallet that has the last position in the list, i.e. it has the lowest amount among the first 100 holders, has a voting power of one! And the wallet that has the highest position among 100 holders has the power of 100 votes.
